  <br><p>Dr. John Thie, DC - Chiropractor, Visionary, Leader, Teacher and the creator of Touch For Health was a man who helped hundreds of thousands people across the globe.</p>

<p>While John Thie has excelled in many areas of his life, I like to think of him as the founder of Touch For Health (TFH) kinesiology, a beautiful system based on muscle monitoring biofeedback combining elements of western and eastern healing modalities. TFH balances help to unlock the potentials we all have and help us creating a fulfilled life.</p>
